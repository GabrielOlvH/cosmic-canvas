## Abstract

This systematic literature review synthesizes findings from 147 sources examining the effects of microgravity and spaceflight on immune system function and disease resistance in biological organisms. The analysis reveals consistent evidence of immune system dysregulation across multiple model systems, including compromised innate and adaptive immune responses, altered immune cell distributions, and impaired pathogen resistance. However, significant contradictions exist regarding microbial virulence changes, with some studies reporting enhanced pathogen virulence while others observe decreased or unchanged virulence phenotypes. The literature demonstrates that spaceflight affects both host immunity and microbial characteristics, creating a complex interplay that may influence disease susceptibility during space missions.

## Introduction

This review examines 147 sources addressing the research question: What are the effects of microgravity and spaceflight on immune system function and disease resistance in biological organisms? The sources encompass studies conducted during actual spaceflight missions, ground-based microgravity analogs, and various model organisms including humans, rodents, Drosophila, and microorganisms.

## Literature Review

### Immune System Dysregulation in Microgravity

Multiple sources document significant immune system alterations during spaceflight. Astronauts experience compromised immune responses under spaceflight conditions, with cellular alterations affecting both innate and adaptive immune systems (doc_356_1582-10). Spaceflight has been shown to alter monocyte responses to Gram-negative toxins (doc_356_1582-10). Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune-related conditions (doc_19_pone.0086485).

The dysregulation affects multiple immune cell types. Exposure to microgravity leads to significant alterations in immune cell function, including a shift in macrophage polarization from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, reduced dendritic cell antigen presentation capacity, increased neutrophil numbers with declining functionality, and diminished natural killer cell cytotoxic activity (Yang & J., 2021). T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production are suppressed, accompanied by decreased IL-2R expression (Yang & J., 2021).

### Microbial Virulence and Pathogenicity Changes

The literature presents contradictory findings regarding microbial virulence in space. Evidence for increased microbial virulence has been collected from both spaceflight-analog systems and actual spaceflight (doc_8_41526_2016_Art). Spaceflight experiments have demonstrated that enteric pathogens like Salmonella typhimurium increased in virulence in mouse infection models (doc_8_41526_2016_Art). Bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli exhibit increased virulence, antibiotic resistance, stress tolerance, and biofilm formation under microgravity conditions (Yang & J., 2021).

However, other studies report contrasting results. Spaceflight conditions do not lead to increased virulence or microbial characteristics that would directly impact crew health in some cases (Wingerter et al., 2023). Using macrophage infection assays, researchers found no significant difference in virulence of Burkholderia species isolated from the ISS compared to Earth controls (Wingerter et al., 2023). Investigation of four common clinical pathogens revealed they were less virulent in space regarding their ability to kill Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes (Wingerter et al., 2023).

### Immune Cell Alterations and Functional Impairment

Spaceflight induces specific changes in immune cell populations and functions. Virtually all immune populations are reduced after spaceflight (Space Research, 2014). Studies show alterations in leukocyte subsets and neutrophil function after spaceflight (Kim & W., 2019). Monocyte phenotype and cytokine production profiles are dysregulated by short-duration spaceflight (doc_394_pone.0124380).

The functional impairments extend to multiple immune parameters. Spaceflight alters the response of monocytes to endotoxins of gram-negative bacteria (doc_394_pone.0124380). Changes in neutrophil functions occur in astronauts, affecting their ability to respond to pathogens (Kim & W., 2019). The cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells is diminished, potentially impairing immune surveillance (Yang & J., 2021).

### Latent Virus Reactivation and Infection Susceptibility

A consistent finding across multiple studies is the reactivation of latent viruses during spaceflight. Multiple latent viruses reactivate in astronauts during Space Shuttle missions (Kim & W., 2019). Reports document increased reactivation of latent viruses including Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Varicella-Zoster virus pre-, during, and post-spaceflight compared to healthy ground control individuals (doc_394_pone.0124380).

The susceptibility to infections increases under spaceflight conditions. Simulation of microgravity-associated decreased immune response using hind limb unloaded mouse models showed enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infection (doc_356_1582-10). Animals under simulated microgravity showed impaired ability to respond to pathogen attack (doc_567_ijms-18-0116).

## Methodological Overview

The reviewed studies employed diverse methodologies including actual spaceflight missions on the Space Shuttle, International Space Station, and biosatellites. Ground-based analogs included hindlimb suspension models, clinostats, random positioning machines, and parabolic flights. Sample sizes varied considerably, from individual astronauts to small animal cohorts. Study designs encompassed observational studies, controlled experiments, and various model organisms including humans, rodents, Drosophila, nematodes, and cultured cells.

## Synthesis and Discussion

### Consensus Areas

The literature demonstrates broad consensus on several key findings. Immune system dysregulation occurs consistently during both short and long-duration spaceflight missions (Crucian & B., 2024). All sources agree that spaceflight compromises immune function through multiple mechanisms affecting both innate and adaptive immunity. The reactivation of latent viruses is well-documented across multiple studies (Kim & W., 2019). There is universal agreement that spaceflight alters immune cell distributions and functions.

### Contradictory Findings

Major contradictions exist regarding microbial virulence changes. While some studies report enhanced pathogen virulence (doc_8_41526_2016_Art; Yang & J., 2021), others find decreased or unchanged virulence (Wingerter et al., 2023). These conflicting results may stem from differences in experimental protocols, pathogen species studied, or assay conditions. The variability in virulence responses suggests that generalizations about microbial behavior in space may be inappropriate.

### Discrepancies

Unexplained differences exist in the magnitude and persistence of immune alterations. Some studies report immune dysfunction persisting up to 6 months post-mission (doc_86_fmicb-11-5153), while others observe more transient effects. The degree of immune compromise varies between individuals and may depend on mission duration, individual susceptibility, and other factors not fully characterized.

### Competing Frameworks

Different theoretical approaches exist for understanding spaceflight-induced immune dysfunction. Some researchers emphasize the role of stress hormones and neuroendocrine factors (doc_394_pone.0124380), while others focus on direct effects of microgravity on immune cells (Yang & J., 2021). The relative contributions of these mechanisms remain debated.

### Study Limitations

Authors acknowledge several limitations including small sample sizes, difficulty in controlling for all spaceflight variables, and challenges in developing accurate ground-based analogs (Kim & W., 2019). The complexity of the space environment makes it difficult to isolate specific effects of microgravity from other factors like radiation, stress, and circadian disruption.

## Contradictions and Conflicts in the Literature

- Wilson et al. (2007) and multiple sources report enhanced Salmonella virulence in space, while Wingerter et al. (2023) found no significant difference in Burkholderia virulence between ISS and Earth isolates
- Studies by Kim & W. (2019) demonstrate increased Serratia marcescens virulence after spaceflight, whereas other researchers observed decreased virulence in Listeria monocytogenes, MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans (Wingerter et al., 2023)
- While doc_8_41526_2016_Art supports increased microbial virulence as a consistent finding, Wingerter et al. (2023) conclude that spaceflight conditions do not necessarily lead to increased virulence
- Morrison & Nicholson (2018) critique the concept of a common bacterial "spaceflight response," contradicting studies that propose universal virulence enhancement mechanisms

## Research Gaps and Future Directions

The literature identifies several critical research gaps. No sources adequately address the long-term health consequences of repeated spaceflight exposures on immune function. The interaction between space radiation and microgravity effects on immunity remains poorly understood. Limited data exist on sex-based differences in immune responses to spaceflight. The sources recommend comprehensive analysis of both pathogenic and beneficial microbes and their mutualistic interactions (doc_486_life-12-0049). Future studies should prioritize investigations that include systems biology approaches to obtain comprehensive overviews of gene expression and metabolic networks.

## Key Findings Summary

• Spaceflight consistently induces immune system dysregulation affecting both innate and adaptive immunity (doc_356_1582-10; Yang & J., 2021)
• Multiple immune cell types show altered function, including suppressed T cell activity and diminished NK cell cytotoxicity (Yang & J., 2021)
• Latent virus reactivation occurs frequently during spaceflight (Kim & W., 2019)
• Microbial virulence changes are species-specific and context-dependent, with contradictory results across different pathogens (Wingerter et al., 2023; doc_8_41526_2016_Art)
• Ground-based analogs show enhanced susceptibility to infection under simulated microgravity (doc_356_1582-10)
• Immune dysfunction can persist for months post-mission (doc_86_fmicb-11-5153)
• No universal pattern of increased microbial virulence in space exists, contradicting earlier assumptions (Wingerter et al., 2023)
