# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that learn from data. Unlike traditional programming where we explicitly code rules, machine learning algorithms discover patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

## Key Concepts

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled training data. The model learns to map inputs to known outputs. Common algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures. Examples include:
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Deep Learning
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input. It has revolutionized computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

## Applications

Machine learning powers many modern technologies:
- Recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon)
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing and chatbots
- Autonomous vehicles
- Fraud detection in banking
- Medical diagnosis assistance

## The Future

As computational power increases and datasets grow larger, machine learning continues to advance. Areas like reinforcement learning, transfer learning, and few-shot learning are pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
