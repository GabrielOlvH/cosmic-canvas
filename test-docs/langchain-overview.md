# LangChain: Building Applications with LLMs

LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides a standardized interface for working with different LLM providers and tools for building complex AI applications.

## Core Components

### Models
LangChain supports multiple LLM providers including:
- OpenAI (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Google (PaLM, Gemini)
- Hugging Face models
- Local models via Ollama

### Prompts
Templates and utilities for managing prompts:
- PromptTemplate: String-based templates with variables
- ChatPromptTemplate: For chat models
- FewShotPromptTemplate: For few-shot learning examples

### Chains
Sequences of calls to LLMs and other tools:
- LLMChain: Basic chain for prompting an LLM
- Sequential Chains: Chain outputs as inputs
- Router Chains: Conditional branching logic

### Agents
Autonomous entities that can use tools and make decisions:
- ReAct agents: Reason and act iteratively
- Plan-and-Execute agents: Plan steps then execute
- Custom agents: Build your own logic

### Memory
Systems for maintaining conversation context:
- ConversationBufferMemory: Store entire conversation
- ConversationSummaryMemory: Summarize old messages
- VectorStoreMemory: Semantic memory retrieval

### Document Loaders
Load data from various sources:
- Text files, PDFs, Word documents
- Web pages and sitemaps
- Databases (SQL, MongoDB)
- APIs (Notion, Google Drive)

### Text Splitters
Break documents into chunks for processing:
- RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter: Split by characters recursively
- TokenTextSplitter: Split by token count
- MarkdownTextSplitter: Respect markdown structure

### Embeddings
Generate vector representations of text:
- OpenAI Embeddings
- Hugging Face Embeddings
- Cohere Embeddings

### Vector Stores
Store and query embeddings:
- MemoryVectorStore: In-memory for development
- Chroma: Persistent local storage
- Pinecone: Managed cloud service
- Supabase: PostgreSQL with pgvector

## Common Patterns

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
1. Load documents
2. Split into chunks
3. Generate embeddings
4. Store in vector database
5. Retrieve relevant chunks for queries
6. Generate answers with LLM + context

### Conversational AI
1. Set up chat model
2. Configure memory system
3. Create conversation chain
4. Handle multi-turn dialogue

### Agents with Tools
1. Define available tools
2. Initialize agent with LLM
3. Agent decides which tools to use
4. Execute and return results

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate chunk sizes for your use case
- Implement proper error handling
- Cache embeddings when possible
- Monitor token usage and costs
- Test prompts thoroughly
- Version your prompts and chains
