## Abstract
This review synthesizes evidence on how microgravity and spaceflight affect immune system function and disease resistance across organisms, focusing on host immunity and pathogen behavior (Crucian & B., 2019; Biol, 2017; doc_356_1582-10; Shi & L., 2025). Across multiple models, spaceflight/microgravity is associated with dysregulation of innate and adaptive immunity, including suppressed T cell activation/proliferation and disrupted signaling, reduced natural killer (NK) cytotoxicity, dendritic cell antigen-presentation deficits, altered monocyte responses, and shifts in macrophage polarization, with some reports of reduced overall immune cell populations after spaceflight (Biol, 2017; doc_356_1582-10; Shi & L., 2025; Stervbo & U., 2024). Animal and analog studies indicate decreased disease resistance, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections under hindlimb unloading and under combined simulated microgravity and radiation, while in Drosophila hypergravity improved resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infection and in crewmembers it remains unclear whether immune compromise increases disease susceptibility (doc_567_ijms-18-01166; doc_19_pone.0086485; doc_8_41526_2016_Article_2). Pathogens display increased growth, antibiotic resistance, virulence, and enhanced stress resistance phenotypes in spaceflight/microgravity, alongside global transcriptional/proteomic changes (Crucian & B., 2019; doc_356_1582-10). Key contradictions include reports of virtually all immune populations being reduced after spaceflight versus increased neutrophil numbers with diminished functionality under microgravity, uncertainty regarding human disease susceptibility despite animal susceptibility, and inconsistent correspondence between simulated and true microgravity studies (Biol, 2017; Shi & L., 2025; doc_8_41526_2016_Article_2; doc_345_fmicb-07-00999).

## Introduction
Spaceflight and microgravity alter the immune system at both organismic and cellular levels, implicating hematopoietic and myeloid compartments among other immune elements (doc_91_nihms507980). Decreased immune responsiveness has been observed during and after spaceflight in humans, animals, and cell cultures, with likely multifactorial causes including physiological stress, circadian disruption, microgravity exposure, isolation, altered nutrition, and radiation exposure (doc_8_41526_2016_Article_2). At least three spaceflight stressors—altered inertial environment, low-dose/low-dose-rate radiation, and physiological/psychological stress—each independently impact immune function based on ground studies (Biol, 2017). Concurrently, pathogens encountered in space habitats can exhibit increased growth, antibiotic resistance, and virulence under spaceflight conditions, heightening infectious risks in the context of immune dysregulation (Crucian & B., 2019).

## Literature Review

### Innate immune alterations under microgravity/spaceflight
Spaceflight alters monocyte responsiveness, with monocytes isolated from astronauts preflight and in flight displaying changed responses to Gram-negative toxins (doc_356_1582-10). Microgravity is associated with a shift in macrophage polarization from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes and reduced dendritic cell antigen presentation, potentially blunting early innate responses (Shi & L., 2025). Neutrophil numbers have been reported to increase under microgravity while functionality declines, indicating impaired innate effector capacity despite potential numerical increases (Shi & L., 2025). NK cell cytotoxic activity is diminished under microgravity, and impaired NK function has been reported during long-duration spaceflight in humans, reflecting compromised immune surveillance (Shi & L., 2025; Stervbo & U., 2024). In-flight and parabolic flight studies further indicate acute reductions in circulating innate and adaptive leukocyte subsets, consistent with transient leukocyte redistribution under gravitational stress (Stervbo & U., 2024).

### Adaptive immune alterations and signaling disruptions
Spaceflight/microgravity suppresses T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production, accompanied by decreased IL-2 receptor expression, indicating impaired adaptive immune activation (Shi & L., 2025). Molecular disruptions involve key signaling pathways, including RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and NF-κB, which are integral to immune cell activation and function (Shi & L., 2025). Long-duration spaceflight is associated with persistent alterations in adaptive immunity in astronauts, consistent with sustained dysregulation beyond acute mission phases (Stervbo & U., 2024). Rodent spaceflight studies report thymic gene expression changes affecting stress responses, T-cell signaling activity, and glucocorticoid receptor pathways, including upregulation of Rbm3, Ctla-4, IFN-a2a and downregulation of Hsph110, Hsp90aa1, Cxcl10, Strip1, Fkbp4m, and CD44 in thymus after 13 days, supporting transcriptional reprogramming of adaptive compartments (doc_113_41526_2024_Article_392). Historical human and animal data document post-flight hematologic changes such as monocytopenia and altered colony-forming units in bone marrow, although some findings vary between missions (doc_91_nihms507980).

### Disease resistance outcomes in animals, insects, plants, and humans
Hindlimb unloading, a rodent analog of microgravity, impairs resistance to infection and increases susceptibility to bacterial challenge, indicating reduced disease resistance under microgravity-like conditions (doc_567_ijms-18-01166). Combined exposure to simulated microgravity and high energy protons results in lack of T cell activation and susceptibility to otherwise non-toxic Pseudomonas aeruginosa, highlighting synergistic decrements in host defense under multiple space-related stressors (doc_567_ijms-18-01166). In Drosophila, hypergravity improved resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in a gravitaxis mutant, and spaceflight alone altered transcriptional profiles in adult flies, revealing gravity-dependent modulation of innate immune pathways (doc_19_pone.0086485). In plants, microgravity increases susceptibility to pathogenic colonization, extending immune susceptibility phenotypes beyond animals (Schohn & C., 2013). Despite these observations, it remains unclear whether compromised immune responses in crewmembers directly lead to increased disease susceptibility during spaceflight, indicating a gap in human clinical outcome evidence (doc_8_41526_2016_Article_2).

### Pathogen behavior and virulence in spaceflight/microgravity
Opportunistic pathogenic bacteria demonstrate increased growth, antibiotic resistance, and virulence under spaceflight conditions, heightening infectious disease risks for crews in a closed habitat (Crucian & B., 2019). Bacterial obligate and opportunistic pathogens exhibit enhanced stress resistance phenotypes after growth in true spaceflight and in microgravity analogs, with documented global transcriptional and proteomic changes in response to the spaceflight environment, suggesting pathogen adaptation that may exacerbate host vulnerability (doc_356_1582-10).

### Integrated stressors and systemic immune dysregulation
The spaceflight environment encompasses altered inertia, radiation, and psychological/physiological stress, each independently capable of impairing immune function, and their combination likely produces complex immune perturbations observed in flight (Biol, 2017). Human and animal studies show reductions in immune populations and changes in lymphocyte distributions, with alterations in thymus and spleen mass and stress hormone profiles consistent with systemic immune dysregulation (Biol, 2017). Astronauts frequently display altered leukocyte counts and functions, along with chronic low-grade inflammation, potentially linked to oxidative damage encountered in-flight (doc_449_41526_2023_Article_293).

## Methodological Overview
Multiple experimental approaches are used to study microgravity effects on immunity, including true spaceflight, parabolic flights, and ground-based analogs such as rotating wall vessels (RWV), 2D clinostats, random positioning machines (RPM), and rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) (doc_567_ijms-18-01166; Stervbo & U., 2024). Simulated microgravity reproduces only some of the biological effects of true microgravity, and results do not always correlate between clinorotation and actual spaceflight, underscoring model limitations (doc_567_ijms-18-01166; doc_345_fmicb-07-00999). Clinostat and RWV design parameters (e.g., vessel diameter and rotational speed) critically affect experimental validity, and even optimal setups do not achieve true weightlessness, necessitating careful interpretation (doc_582_life-12-01399). Parabolic flight studies report acute reductions in circulating innate and adaptive leukocyte subsets, providing short-duration human data on gravitational stress effects (Stervbo & U., 2024). Some in-flight rodent studies incorporate transcriptomic analyses of immune tissues to identify gene expression changes linked to T-cell signaling and stress pathways (doc_113_41526_2024_Article_392). Methodological challenges include limited opportunities for spaceflight experiments, varied onboard sampling constraints, issues of hardware orientation in culture systems, and inconsistent findings across missions and platforms, including conflicting CFU-M outcomes in rats after similar flights (doc_449_41526_2023_Article_293; doc_91_nihms507980). There is no sufficiently accurate ground-based analog for immune suppression, and authors recommend leveraging facilities such as ISS onboard centrifuges to benchmark simulators against spaceflight controls (doc_8_41526_2016_Article_2; doc_264_fpls-10-01577).

## Synthesis and Discussion
- Consensus Areas: Multiple sources converge on the conclusion that spaceflight/microgravity dysregulates immunity across innate and adaptive compartments, with suppressed T cell activation/signaling, reduced NK cytotoxic function, altered monocyte/macrophage behavior, and global changes in immune cell distribution and function (Shi & L., 2025; Stervbo & U., 2024; Biol, 2017; doc_356_1582-10). There is broad agreement that pathogens adapt under spaceflight/microgravity to become more stress-resistant, and some opportunistic pathogens exhibit increased growth, antibiotic resistance, and virulence, compounding infectious risks in the context of host immune dysregulation (Crucian & B., 2019; doc_356_1582-10). Animal models and analogs indicate decreased disease resistance, including impaired responses to bacterial infection during hindlimb unloading and greater susceptibility when microgravity is combined with radiation, supporting a functional decrement in host defense under space-relevant stressors (doc_567_ijms-18-01166).  
- Contradictory Findings: Reports of “virtually all immune populations” being reduced after spaceflight contrast with findings that neutrophil numbers increase while functionality declines under microgravity, indicating divergent observations about cell counts versus function and specific lineages (Biol, 2017; Shi & L., 2025). In Drosophila, hypergravity improved resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infection, which contrasts with the general pattern of immune suppression in microgravity and indicates gravity-dependent bidirectional effects on immunity (doc_19_pone.0086485). While animal and analog studies demonstrate increased susceptibility to infection, uncertainty remains as to whether immune compromise translates into increased disease susceptibility in crewmembers, highlighting a human–model discrepancy (doc_567_ijms-18-01166; doc_8_41526_2016_Article_2). In rodents, CFU-M outcomes in bone marrow were inconsistent across two similar shuttle flights, pointing to reproducibility challenges (doc_91_nihms507980). Simulated microgravity results sometimes align with spaceflight data and sometimes do not, revealing model-dependent inconsistencies (doc_345_fmicb-07-00999).  
- Discrepancies: Variability in human findings is attributed to low sample sizes and mission constraints, while differences in hardware, orientation, and platform design limit direct comparability across studies and may underlie divergent outcomes (Crucian & B., 2019; doc_91_nihms507980). Short-duration gravitational stress (parabolic flights) shows acute leukocyte reductions, whereas longer-term exposures reveal complex transcriptional and functional changes, suggesting time-scale dependencies (Stervbo & U., 2024; doc_113_41526_2024_Article_392).  
- Competing Frameworks: Mechanistic framings include direct microgravity effects on immune signaling pathways (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, NF-κB) versus systemic stress/oxidative damage as drivers of chronic low-grade inflammation, reflecting different emphases on cell-intrinsic signaling versus organismal stress responses (Shi & L., 2025; doc_449_41526_2023_Article_293).  
- Study Limitations: Authors highlight the absence of a fully accurate ground-based analog for immune suppression, limited access to spaceflight platforms, and the need for integrated multi-stressor studies including relevant radiation spectra to better mimic the flight environment (doc_8_41526_2016_Article_2; doc_567_ijms-18-01166; doc_395_rrw051). Methodological concerns such as hardware orientation and the partial fidelity of simulated microgravity devices further constrain inference from analog studies to spaceflight conditions (doc_91_nihms507980; doc_582_life-12-01399).

## Contradictions and Conflicts in the Literature
- Biol, 2017 reports that virtually all immune populations are reduced after spaceflight, while Shi & L., 2025 reports neutrophil numbers increase under microgravity although functionality declines.  
- doc_567_ijms-18-01166 reports increased infection susceptibility in animals under hindlimb unloading and combined microgravity/radiation, while doc_8_41526_2016_Article_2 states it is still unclear whether immune compromise increases disease susceptibility in crewmembers.  
- doc_19_pone.0086485 reports hypergravity improved Drosophila resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infection, while multiple sources report immune suppression under microgravity/spaceflight, indicating gravity-dependent opposing effects.  
- doc_91_nihms507980 notes inconsistencies in CFU-M outcomes in rats after two similar space shuttle flights, challenging reproducibility.  
- doc_345_fmicb-07-00999 states that simulated microgravity and true spaceflight results correlate in some cases but not in others, contradicting assumptions of universal analog fidelity.

## Research Gaps and Future Directions
- Whether spaceflight-associated immune compromise increases disease susceptibility in crewmembers remains unresolved, necessitating in-flight clinical outcome studies (doc_8_41526_2016_Article_2).  
- More research using multiple forms and combinations of space-relevant radiation is needed to better mimic exposure during flight and to elucidate long-term immune defense consequences (doc_395_rrw051).  
- There is no sufficiently accurate ground-based analog for immune suppression; benchmarking simulators against spaceflight using onboard centrifuges and harmonized protocols is recommended to improve comparability (doc_8_41526_2016_Article_2; doc_264_fpls-10-01577).  
- Mechanistic elucidation of immune signaling disruptions under microgravity, including RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and NF-κB pathways, should be expanded across cell types and species to inform countermeasures (Shi & L., 2025).  
- Integrated studies addressing combined stressors—microgravity, radiation, and psychological/physiological stress—are needed to explain complex immune phenotypes observed in the spaceflight environment (Biol, 2017).

## Key Findings Summary
- Spaceflight/microgravity dysregulates immunity across innate and adaptive compartments in humans and model organisms (Crucian & B., 2019; Biol, 2017).  
- T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production are suppressed under microgravity, with disruptions in RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and NF-κB signaling (Shi & L., 2025).

- Pathogens exhibit increased growth, antibiotic resistance, virulence, and enhanced stress resistance in spaceflight/microgravity, with global transcriptional/proteomic changes (Crucian & B., 2019; doc_356_1582-10).  
- Hypergravity can enhance Drosophila resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections, demonstrating gravity-dependent bidirectionality in immune outcomes (doc_19_pone.0086485).  
- Simulated microgravity does not fully replicate spaceflight; results sometimes diverge, underscoring methodological limitations and the need for in-flight controls (doc_567_ijms-18-01166; doc_345_fmicb-07-00999).
