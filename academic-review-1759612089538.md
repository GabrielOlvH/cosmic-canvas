## Abstract
Across humans, animals, plants, and microbial systems, spaceflight and microgravity are associated with immune dysregulation, altered disease resistance, and shifts in host–pathogen dynamics (doc_396_pone.0174174; Ott & C., 2013; Foster & J., 2014). In mammals, reported effects include reductions in immune cell populations, impaired T cell and NK cell function, altered cytokines/hormonal regulation, and reactivation of latent herpesviruses (doc_396_pone.0174174; Radabaugh & T., 2022; doc_297_pbae007; Environ, 2015; Spaceflight Opportunities, 2014; doc_302_41564_2024_A). Rodent hindlimb unloading and combined radiation–unloading analogs demonstrate increased susceptibility to bacterial infection and impaired T cell activation, linking spaceflight-relevant stressors to decreased disease resistance (doc_567_ijms-18-01166; Environ, 2015). In invertebrates, Drosophila innate immune pathways are altered by spaceflight, while hypergravity can enhance Toll-mediated resistance to fungal infection (Space, 2014). From the pathogen perspective, several bacteria and fungi display increased virulence, stress resistance, and biofilm formation under spaceflight or low-shear modeled microgravity, though some studies report decreased or unchanged virulence, indicating heterogeneity (Wilson & J., 2021; Juergensmeyer & M., 2019; doc_515_41522_2021_A; doc_367_pone.0080677; Foster & J., 2014; Knox & B., 2023). Plants exhibit increased susceptibility to pathogenic colonization in microgravity, extending the immune vulnerability theme beyond animals (Foster & J., 2014). Major contradictions include reports of both increased and decreased pathogen virulence in spaceflight conditions and variable host immune outcomes across models and durations (Foster & J., 2014; doc_367_pone.0080677; Knox & B., 2023; doc_396_pone.0174174).

## Introduction
This review synthesizes published findings on how microgravity and spaceflight affect immune system function and disease resistance in biological organisms, encompassing human, animal, plant, and microbial studies conducted in flight and in ground-based analogs (Ott & C., 2013; Foster & J., 2014; Space, 2014). Because access to true spaceflight is limited, many investigations use analog platforms (e.g., rotating wall vessel bioreactors, random positioning machines, hindlimb unloading, parabolic flights), which only partially reproduce in-flight conditions and can yield responses that differ from spaceflight, necessitating cautious interpretation (doc_567_ijms-18-01166; doc_449_41526_2023_A; Spaceflight Opportunities, 2014). No sources in this review address the exact number of sources analyzed.

## Literature Review

### Immune dysregulation in humans during spaceflight
Multiple studies report immune dysregulation in astronauts, including changes in leukocyte distributions and function, altered cytokine profiles, and overall reductions in immune populations post-flight (doc_396_pone.0174174; Ott & C., 2013). Altered in vivo hormonal regulation of immunity and cytokine concentrations have been documented during long-duration missions (doc_297_pbae007). NK cell function is impaired during long-duration spaceflight, and adaptive immunity alterations persist in-flight (Lang & J., 2024). Reactivation of latent herpesviruses (e.g., EBV, CMV, VZV) is repeatedly observed pre-, during, and post-flight and is associated with stress markers (Environ, 2015; Spaceflight Opportunities, 2014; doc_302_41564_2024_A). Reports of opportunistic infections (e.g., urinary tract, respiratory, conjunctivitis, dental) in Shuttle and Mir missions underscore clinical relevance (Spaceflight Opportunities, 2014).

### Cellular and molecular mechanisms in immune cells
Microgravity suppresses T cell activation and early activation gene expression, and disrupts signaling pathways including RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and NF-κB (Martinez & E., 2062; Radabaugh & T., 2022). Observed shifts include reduced T cell activity, diminished NK cytotoxicity, increased neutrophil counts with functional decline, reduced dendritic cell antigen presentation, and a macrophage polarization shift toward M2, collectively impairing immune surveillance and response (Radabaugh & T., 2022). Monocyte responses to Gram-negative endotoxins are altered preflight and in-flight, reflecting innate immune perturbation (doc_356_1582-10). Spaceflight also influences immune organs (thymus, spleen) and stress hormones, consistent with systemic immune modulation (doc_396_pone.0174174).

### Animal models and spaceflight analogs: impacts on disease resistance
Rodent hindlimb unloading (HU) reduces resistance to pathogens, with increased susceptibility to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, and combined HU with proton radiation further impairs T cell activation and increases susceptibility (doc_567_ijms-18-01166; Environ, 2015). Animal studies consistently show that spaceflight and its stressors (microgravity, radiation, physiological/psychological stress) affect immune cell distributions, organ masses, and glucocorticoids, supporting a multi-factorial basis for immune dysfunction (doc_396_pone.0174174). In Drosophila, spaceflight alters innate immune responses, whereas hypergravity exposure improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infection, indicating gravity-level dependence of immune efficacy (Space, 2014).

### Pathogen adaptation and virulence under spaceflight conditions
Spaceflight and low-shear modeled microgravity can enhance virulence and stress resistance in multiple pathogens, including Salmonella Typhimurium and Serratia marcescens, and promote biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Wilson & J., 2021; Juergensmeyer & M., 2019; doc_515_41522_2021_A). Global transcriptional/proteomic changes occur in microorganisms under spaceflight, with regulatory nodes such as Hfq implicated in virulence modulation (doc_356_1582-10; Wilson & J., 2021). However, some studies report decreased virulence (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes, MRSA, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans in C. elegans assays) or no significant changes for certain ISS isolates, revealing heterogeneous pathogen responses (Foster & J., 2014; Knox & B., 2023).

### Viral reactivation and clinical correlates
Latent herpesvirus reactivation is well documented among astronauts and is linked to altered stress hormones and immune control, with implications for disease risk during missions (Environ, 2015; Spaceflight Opportunities, 2014; doc_302_41564_2024_A).

### Microbiome and host–microbe interactions
Spaceflight is thought to induce dysbiosis, potentially altering host–microbe interactions and immune function, and murine and astronaut microbiome studies indicate spaceflight-associated changes (Ott & C., 2013; doc_464_40168_2019_A; Zwart & S., 2024). Built-environment microbiology aboard ISS and bidirectional exchange with crew microbiomes may promote opportunistic pathogenicity, emphasizing ecosystem-level influences on immunity and infection risk (Lang & J., 2024).

### Plant immunity and disease susceptibility
Plants show increased susceptibility to pathogenic colonization in microgravity, expanding the theme of compromised disease resistance to the plant kingdom during spaceflight (Foster & J., 2014).

## Methodological Overview
Investigations span in-flight human and rodent studies aboard Shuttle/ISS and ground-based analogs including rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors/low-shear modeled microgravity, random positioning machines (RPM), hindlimb unloading (HU), and parabolic flights, each modeling distinct aspects of the space exposome (Spaceflight Opportunities, 2014; doc_567_ijms-18-01166; doc_449_41526_2023_A). Multi-omic profiling (transcriptomics, proteomics), immunophenotyping, cytokine assays, and infection challenge models have been used across systems to assess immune function and pathogen virulence (Wilson & J., 2021; doc_396_pone.0174174; doc_297_pbae007; Juergensmeyer & M., 2019). Notably, analogs simulate only subsets of spaceflight conditions and can yield discordant results relative to true microgravity, underscoring the need for direct in-flight studies (doc_567_ijms-18-01166; Spaceflight Opportunities, 2014; doc_449_41526_2023_A).

## Synthesis and Discussion
- Consensus Areas: There is broad agreement that spaceflight perturbs immune function in mammals, including reductions in immune cell populations, altered cytokines/hormonal regulation, impaired T/NK cell function, and latent herpesvirus reactivation (doc_396_pone.0174174; doc_297_pbae007; Radabaugh & T., 2022; Environ, 2015; Spaceflight Opportunities, 2014). Rodent HU and combined radiation–HU models consistently demonstrate increased infection susceptibility and impaired T cell activation, supporting causative roles for spaceflight-relevant stressors (doc_567_ijms-18-01166; Environ, 2015). Pathogens often exhibit increased virulence or biofilm formation under spaceflight or low-shear conditions, elevating infectious risk (Wilson & J., 2021; Juergensmeyer & M., 2019; doc_515_41522_2021_A). Plants show greater disease susceptibility in microgravity (Foster & J., 2014).
- Contradictory Findings: While several studies show heightened microbial virulence, others report decreased virulence in spaceflight for diverse pathogens or no significant virulence increase for certain ISS isolates, indicating organism- and context-specific outcomes (Foster & J., 2014; doc_367_pone.0080677; Knox & B., 2023). Drosophila studies indicate hypergravity can enhance resistance to fungal infection, contrasting with immune suppression reported under microgravity (Space, 2014; doc_103_pone.0062437).
- Discrepancies: Differences in pathogen species/strains, host models (e.g., Drosophila versus mammals), environmental conditions (nutrient/ion composition, fluid shear), and assay endpoints (e.g., C. elegans lethality versus murine infection) likely contribute to divergent virulence results (Wilson & J., 2021; Foster & J., 2014; doc_515_41522_2021_A). Analog platforms variably recapitulate microgravity, which may explain inconsistent host immune outcomes (doc_567_ijms-18-01166; Spaceflight Opportunities, 2014).
- Competing Frameworks: An integrated “space exposome” perspective posits combined effects of microgravity, radiation, circadian disruption, and stress on immunity, versus single-factor models focusing on microgravity or low-shear alone (Ott & C., 2013; doc_396_pone.0174174). Mechanistic frameworks emphasize disrupted immune signaling (NF-κB, RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK), cell-type–specific dysfunction, and pathogen mechanotransduction (Radabaugh & T., 2022; Wilson & J., 2021).
- Study Limitations: Authors note limitations including reliance on analogs that do not fully mimic spaceflight, onboard experimental constraints, low sample sizes, and assay differences; specific studies acknowledge incomplete mechanistic profiling (e.g., qPCR-only, pending RNA-seq) and lack of host–pathogen metabolomics (doc_567_ijms-18-01166; doc_449_41526_2023_A; Spaceflight Opportunities, 2014; doc_165_main).

## Contradictions and Conflicts in the Literature
- Foster & J., 2014 reports an overall decrease in virulence of multiple pathogens in C. elegans under spaceflight, while Juergensmeyer & M., 2019 reports increased virulence of Serratia marcescens after ISS growth or simulated microgravity (Foster & J., 2014; Juergensmeyer & M., 2019).
- Crabbe et al. report no increased virulence of Candida albicans in a murine model despite spaceflight-induced phenotypic changes, whereas Wilson & J., 2021 and others report increased virulence for Salmonella under spaceflight/analog conditions (doc_367_pone.0080677; Wilson & J., 2021).
- Knox & B., 2023 notes cases where ISS isolates did not show increased virulence compared to Earth controls, contrasting with studies documenting heightened virulence or biofilm formation in other organisms (Knox & B., 2023; doc_515_41522_2021_A).
- Space, 2014 indicates hypergravity improves Drosophila resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infection, whereas doc_103_pone.0062437 notes suppression of innate immunity in Drosophila and mouse models under spaceflight, suggesting gravity-dependent and model-dependent immune effects (Space, 2014; doc_103_pone.0062437).

## Research Gaps and Future Directions
- It remains unclear whether the compromised immune response in astronauts directly translates to increased overall disease susceptibility across mission contexts, and no sufficiently accurate ground-based analog fully captures spaceflight immune suppression, indicating a need for more in-flight, mechanistically detailed infection studies (Andrievskiy & A., 2016). 
- The role of microbiome alterations in mediating immune dysregulation and latent viral reactivation warrants further investigation to mitigate risks during long-duration missions (Ott & C., 2013). 
- Authors emphasize that analog models incompletely reproduce spaceflight and can produce disparate results, underscoring the importance of ISS- and exploration-class in-flight experiments across species and pathogens (doc_567_ijms-18-01166; doc_449_41526_2023_A).
- Studies recommend expanding Drosophila ISS research with diverse pathogens and genotypes, and considering artificial gravity as a potential countermeasure for immune perturbations (Space, 2014).
- No sources in this review address vaccine efficacy or immunization responses during spaceflight.

## Key Findings Summary
- Spaceflight is associated with reductions in immune cell populations and altered leukocyte distributions and stress hormones in mammals (doc_396_pone.0174174).
- T cell activation and signaling pathways (RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, NF-κB) are suppressed/disrupted by microgravity, with diminished NK cytotoxicity and altered monocyte/neutrophil functions (Radabaugh & T., 2022; doc_356_1582-10).
- Cytokine and hormonal regulation of immunity are altered during long-duration spaceflight (doc_297_pbae007).
- Latent herpesviruses reactivate in astronauts during and after missions, correlating with stress indicators (Environ, 2015; Spaceflight Opportunities, 2014).
- Rodent hindlimb unloading and combined radiation–unloading increase susceptibility to bacterial infections and impair T cell activation, modeling decreased disease resistance (doc_567_ijms-18-01166; Environ, 2015).
- Drosophila innate immune responses are altered by spaceflight, while hypergravity can enhance Toll-mediated resistance to fungal infection (Space, 2014).
- Several pathogens exhibit increased virulence, stress resistance, or biofilm formation under spaceflight/low-shear conditions (Wilson & J., 2021; Juergensmeyer & M., 2019; doc_515_41522_2021_A).
- Contradictory evidence shows decreased or unchanged virulence for certain organisms and conditions, indicating heterogeneity (Foster & J., 2014; doc_367_pone.0080677; Knox & B., 2023).
- Spaceflight-associated microbiome changes occur in mice and are implicated in human missions, with built-environment exchanges potentially promoting opportunistic pathogenicity (doc_464_40168_2019_A; Zwart & S., 2024; Lang & J., 2024).
- Plants are more susceptible to pathogen colonization in microgravity, extending immune vulnerability beyond animals (Foster & J., 2014).
